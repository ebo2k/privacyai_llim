The information provided shall describe in general the business’s verification process and when the consumer should expect a response, except in instances where the business has already granted or denied the request. The confirmation may be given in the same manner in which the request was received. For example, if the request is made over the phone, the confirmation may be given orally during the phone call. (b) Businesses shall respond to requests to know and requests to delete within 45 calendar days. The 45-day period will begin on the day that the business receives the request, regardless of time required to verify the request. If the business cannot verify the consumer within the 45- day time period, the business may deny the request. If necessary, businesses may take up to an additional 45 calendar days to respond to the consumer’s request, for a maximum total of 90 calendar days from the day the request is received, provided that the business provides the consumer with notice and an explanation of the reason that the business will take more than 45 days to respond to the request. (c) Responding to Requests to Know. (1) For requests that seek the disclosure of specific pieces of information about the consumer, if a business cannot verify the identity of the person making the request pursuant to the regulations set forth in Article 4, the business shall not disclose any specific pieces of personal information to the requestor and shall inform the requestor that it cannot verify their identity. If the request is denied in whole or in part, the business shall also evaluate the consumer’s request as if it is seeking the disclosure of categories of personal information about the consumer pursuant to subsection (c)(2). (2) For requests that seek the disclosure of categories of personal information about the consumer, if a business cannot verify the identity of the person making the request pursuant to the regulations set forth in Article 4, the business may deny the request to disclose the categories and other information requested and shall inform the requestor that it cannot verify their identity. If the request is denied in whole or in part, the business shall provide or direct the consumer to its general business practices regarding the collection, maintenance, and sale of personal information set forth in its privacy policy. (3) In responding to a request to know, a business is not required to search for personal information if all of the following conditions are met: a. The business does not maintain the personal information in a searchable or reasonably accessible format; b. The business maintains the personal information solely for legal or compliance purposes; c. The business does not sell the personal information and does not use it for any commercial purpose; and d.

The business shall, however, inform the consumer with sufficient particularity that it has collected the type of information. For example, a business shall respond that it collects “unique biometric data including a fingerprint scan” without disclosing the actual fingerprint scan data. (5) If a business denies a consumer’s verified request to know specific pieces of personal information, in whole or in part, because of a conflict with federal or state law, or an exception to the CCPA, the business shall inform the requestor and explain the basis for the denial, unless prohibited from doing so by law. If the request is denied only in part, the business shall disclose the other information sought by the consumer. (6) A business shall use reasonable security measures when transmitting personal information to the consumer. (7) If a business maintains a password-protected account with the consumer, it may comply with a request to know by using a secure self-service portal for consumers to access, view, and receive a portable copy of their personal information if the portal fully discloses the personal information that the consumer is entitled to under the CCPA and these regulations, uses reasonable data security controls, and complies with the verification requirements set forth in Article 4. (8) Unless otherwise specified by the business to cover a longer period of time, the 12- month period covered by a consumer’s verifiable request to know referenced in Civil Code section 1798.130, subdivision (a)(2), shall run from the date the business receives the request, regardless of the time required to verify the request. (9) In responding to a consumer’s verified request to know categories of personal information, categories of sources, and/or categories of third parties, a business shall provide an individualized response to the consumer as required by the CCPA. It shall not refer the consumer to the businesses’ general practices outlined in its privacy policy unless its response would be the same for all consumers and the privacy policy discloses all the information that is otherwise required to be in a response to a request to know such categories. (10) In responding to a verified request to know categories of personal information, the business shall provide: a. The categories of personal information the business has collected about the consumer in the preceding 12 months; b. The categories of sources from which the personal information was collected; c. The business or commercial purpose for which it collected or sold the personal information; d. The categories of third parties with whom the business shares personal information; e. The categories of personal information that the business sold in the preceding 12 months, and for each category identified, the categories of third parties to whom it sold that particular category of personal information; and f. The categories of personal information that the business disclosed for a business purpose in the preceding 12 months, and for each category identified, the categories of third parties to whom it disclosed that particular category of personal information. (11) A business shall identify the categories of personal information, categories of sources of personal information, and categories of third parties to whom a business sold or disclosed personal information, in a manner that provides consumers a meaningful understanding of the categories listed. (d) Responding to Requests to Delete. (1) For requests to delete, if a business cannot verify the identity of the requestor pursuant to the regulations set forth in Article 4, the business may deny the request to delete. The business shall inform the requestor that their identity cannot be verified. (2) A business shall comply with a consumer’s request to delete their personal information by: a. Permanently and completely erasing the personal information on its existing systems with the exception of archived or back-up systems; b. Deidentifying the personal information; or c. Aggregating the consumer information. (3) If a business stores any personal information on archived or backup systems, it may delay compliance with the consumer’s request to delete, with respect to data stored on the archived or backup system, until the archived or backup system relating to that data is restored to an active system or next accessed or used for a sale, disclosure, or commercial purpose. (4) In responding to a request to delete, a business shall inform the consumer whether or not it has complied with the consumer’s request. (5) If the business complies with the consumer’s request, the business shall inform the consumer that it will maintain a record of the request as required by section 999.317, subsection (b). A business may retain a record of the request for the purpose of ensuring that the consumer’s personal information remains deleted from the business’s records. (6) In cases where a business denies a consumer’s request to delete, the business shall do all of the following: a. Inform the consumer that it will not comply with the consumer’s request and describe the basis for the denial, including any conflict with federal or state law, or exception to the CCPA, unless prohibited from doing so by law; b. Delete the consumer’s personal information that is not subject to the exception; and c. Not use the consumer’s personal information retained for any other purpose than provided for by that exception. (7) If a business that denies a consumer’s request to delete sells personal information and the consumer has not already made a request to opt-out, the business shall ask the consumer if they would like to opt-out of the sale of their personal information and shall include either the contents of, or a link to, the notice of right to opt-out in accordance with section 999.306. (8) In responding to a request to delete, a business may present the consumer with the choice to delete select portions of their personal information only if a global option to delete all personal information is also offered and more prominently presented than the other choices.",article

Business Practices for Handling Consumer Requests - § 999.314 Service Providers in the California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations (CCPA): (a) A business that provides services to a person or organization that is not a business, and that would otherwise meet the requirements and obligations of a “service provider” under the CCPA and these regulations, shall be deemed a service provider for purposes of the CCPA and these regulations. (b) To the extent that a business directs a second entity to collect personal information directly from a consumer, or about a consumer, on the first business’s behalf, and the second entity would otherwise meet the requirements and obligations of a “service provider” under the CCPA and these regulations, the second entity shall be deemed a service provider of the first business for purposes of the CCPA and these regulations. (c) A service provider shall not retain, use, or disclose personal information obtained in the course of providing services except: (1) To process or maintain personal information on behalf of the business that provided the personal information or directed the service provider to collect the personal information, and in compliance with the written contract for services required by the CCPA; (2) To retain and employ another service provider as a subcontractor, where the subcontractor meets the requirements for a service provider under the CCPA and these regulations; (3) For internal use by the service provider to build or improve the quality of its services, provided that the use does not include building or modifying household or consumer profiles to use in providing services to another business, or correcting or augmenting data acquired from another source; (4) To detect data security incidents or protect against fraudulent or illegal activity; or (5) For the purposes enumerated in Civil Code section 1798.145, subdivisions (a)(1) through (a)(4). (d) A service provider shall not sell data on behalf of a business when a consumer has opted-out of the sale of their personal information with the business. (e) If a service provider receives a request to know or a request to delete from a consumer, the service provider shall either act on behalf of the business in responding to the request or inform the consumer that the request cannot be acted upon because the request has been sent to a service provider. (f) A service provider that is a business shall comply with the CCPA and these regulations with regard to any personal information that it collects, maintains, or sells outside of its role as a service provider.",article

Business Practices for Handling Consumer Requests - § 999.315 Requests to Opt-Out in the California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations (CCPA): (a) A business shall provide two or more designated methods for submitting requests to opt-out, including an interactive form accessible via a clear and conspicuous link titled “Do Not Sell My Personal Information,” on the business’s website or mobile application. Other acceptable methods for submitting these requests include, but are not limited to, a toll-free phone number, a designated email address, a form submitted in person, a form submitted through the mail, and user-enabled global privacy controls, such as a browser plug-in or privacy setting, device setting, or other mechanism, that communicate or signal the consumer’s choice to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. (b) A business shall consider the methods by which it interacts with consumers, the manner in which the business sells personal information to third parties, available technology, and ease of use by the consumer when determining which methods consumers may use to submit requests to opt-out. At least one method offered shall reflect the manner in which the business primarily interacts with the consumer. (c) If a business collects personal information from consumers online, the business shall treat user-enabled global privacy controls, such as a browser plug-in or privacy setting, device setting, or other mechanism, that communicate or signal the consumer’s choice to opt-out of the sale of their personal information as a valid request submitted pursuant to Civil Code section 1798.120 for that browser or device, or, if known, for the consumer. (1) Any privacy control developed in accordance with these regulations shall clearly communicate or signal that a consumer intends to opt-out of the sale of personal information. (2) If a global privacy control conflicts with a consumer’s existing business-specific privacy setting or their participation in a business’s financial incentive program, the business shall respect the global privacy control but may notify the consumer of the conflict and give the consumer the choice to confirm the business-specific privacy setting or participation in the financial incentive program. (d) In responding to a request to opt-out, a business may present the consumer with the choice to opt-out of sale for certain uses of personal information as long as a global option to opt- out of the sale of all personal information is more prominently presented than the other choices. (e) A business shall comply with a request to opt-out as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than 15 business days from the date the business receives the request. If a business sells a consumer’s personal information to any third parties after the consumer submits their request but before the business complies with that request, it shall notify those third parties that the consumer has exercised their right to opt-out and shall direct those third parties not to sell that consumer’s information. (f) A consumer may use an authorized agent to submit a request to opt-out on the consumer’s behalf if the consumer provides the authorized agent written permission signed by the consumer. A business may deny a request from an authorized agent if the agent cannot provide to the business the consumer’s signed permission demonstrating that they have been authorized by the consumer to act on the consumer’s behalf. User-enabled global privacy controls, such as a browser plug-in or privacy setting, device setting, or other mechanism, that communicate or signal the consumer’s choice to opt-out of the sale of their personal information shall be considered a request directly from the consumer, not through an authorized agent. (g) A request to opt-out need not be a verifiable consumer request. If a business, however, has a good-faith, reasonable, and documented belief that a request to opt-out is fraudulent, the business may deny the request. The business shall inform the requestor that it will not comply with the request and shall provide an explanation why it believes the request is fraudulent.",article

(b) If a consumer who has opted-out of the sale of their personal information initiates a transaction or attempts to use a product or service that requires the sale of their personal information, a business may inform the consumer that the transaction, product, or service requires the sale of their personal information and provide instructions on how the consumer can opt-in.",article

The business shall implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices in maintaining these records. (c) The records may be maintained in a ticket or log format provided that the ticket or log includes the date of request, nature of request, manner in which the request was made, the date of the business’s response, the nature of the response, and the basis for the denial of the request if the request is denied in whole or in part. (d) A business’s maintenance of the information required by this section, where that information is not used for any other purpose, does not taken alone violate the CCPA or these regulations. (e) Information maintained for record-keeping purposes shall not be used for any other purpose except as reasonably necessary for the business to review and modify its processes for compliance with the CCPA and these regulations. Information maintained for recordkeeping purposes shall not be shared with any third party except as necessary to comply with a legal obligation. (f) Other than as required by subsection (b), a business is not required to retain personal information solely for the purpose of fulfilling a consumer request made under the CCPA. (g) A business that knows or reasonably should know that it, alone or in combination, buys, receives for the business’s commercial purposes, sells, or shares for commercial purposes the personal information of 10,000,000 or more consumers in a calendar year shall: (1) Compile the following metrics for the previous calendar year: a. The number of requests to know that the business received, complied with in whole or in part, and denied; b. The number of requests to delete that the business received, complied with in whole or in part, and denied; c. The number of requests to opt-out that the business received, complied with in whole or in part, and denied; and d. The median or mean number of days within which the business substantively responded to requests to know, requests to delete, and requests to opt-out. (2) Disclose, by July 1 of every calendar year, the information compiled in subsection (g)(1) within their privacy policy or posted on their website and accessible from a link included in their privacy policy. a. In its disclosure pursuant to subsection (g)(2), a business may choose to disclose the number of requests that it denied in whole or in part because the request was not verifiable, was not made by a consumer, called for information exempt from disclosure, or was denied on other grounds. (3) Establish, document, and comply with a training policy to ensure that all individuals responsible for handling consumer requests made under the CCPA or the business’s compliance with the CCPA are informed of all the requirements in these regulations and the CCPA. (h) A business may choose to compile and disclose the information required by subsection (g)(1) for requests received from all individuals, rather than requests received from consumers.

(b) Where a consumer has a password-protected account with a business that collects personal information about a household, the business may process requests to know and requests to delete relating to household information through the business’s existing business practices and in compliance with these regulations. (c) If a member of a household is a consumer under the age of 13, a business must obtain verifiable parental consent before complying with a request to know specific pieces of information for the household or the deletion of household personal information pursuant to the parental consent provisions in section 999.330.",article

(b) In determining the method by which the business will verify the consumer’s identity, the business shall: (1) Whenever feasible, match the identifying information provided by the consumer to the personal information of the consumer already maintained by the business, or use a third-party identity verification service that complies with this section. (2) Avoid collecting the types of personal information identified in Civil Code section 1798.81.5, subdivision (d), unless necessary for the purpose of verifying the consumer. (3) Consider the following factors: a. The type, sensitivity, and value of the personal information collected and maintained about the consumer. Sensitive or valuable personal information shall warrant a more stringent verification process. The types of personal information identified in Civil Code section 1798.81.5, subdivision (d), shall be considered presumptively sensitive; b. The risk of harm to the consumer posed by any unauthorized access or deletion. A greater risk of harm to the consumer by unauthorized access or deletion shall warrant a more stringent verification process; c. The likelihood that fraudulent or malicious actors would seek the personal information. The higher the likelihood, the more stringent the verification process shall be; d. Whether the personal information to be provided by the consumer to verify their identity is sufficiently robust to protect against fraudulent requests or being spoofed or fabricated; e. The manner in which the business interacts with the consumer; and f. Available technology for verification. (c) A business shall generally avoid requesting additional information from the consumer for purposes of verification. If, however, the business cannot verify the identity of the consumer from the information already maintained by the business, the business may request additional information from the consumer, which shall only be used for the purposes of verifying the identity of the consumer seeking to exercise their rights under the CCPA, security, or fraud-prevention. The business shall delete any new personal information collected for the purposes of verification as soon as practical after processing the consumer’s request, except as required to comply with section 999.317. (d) A business shall not require the consumer or the consumer’s authorized agent to pay a fee for the verification of their request to know or request to delete. For example, a business may not require a consumer to provide a notarized affidavit to verify their identity unless the business compensates the consumer for the cost of notarization. (e) A business shall implement reasonable security measures to detect fraudulent identityverification activity and prevent the unauthorized access to or deletion of a consumer’s personal information. (f) If a business maintains consumer information that is deidentified, a business is not obligated to provide or delete this information in response to a consumer request or to re-identify individual data to verify a consumer request.",article

Verification of Requests - § 999.324 Verification for Password-Protected Accounts in the California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations (CCPA): (a) If a business maintains a password-protected account with the consumer, the business may verify the consumer’s identity through the business’s existing authentication practices for the consumer’s account, provided that the business follows the requirements in section 999.323. The business shall also require a consumer to re-authenticate themself before disclosing or deleting the consumer’s data. (b) If a business suspects fraudulent or malicious activity on or from the password-protected account, the business shall not comply with a consumer’s request to know or request to delete until further verification procedures determine that the consumer request is authentic and the consumer making the request is the person about whom the business has collected information. The business may use the procedures set forth in section 999.325 to further verify the identity of the consumer.",article

Verification of Requests - § 999.325 Verification for Non-Accountholders in the California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations (CCPA): (a) If a consumer does not have or cannot access a password-protected account with a business, the business shall comply with this section, in addition to section 999.323. (b) A business’s compliance with a request to know categories of personal information requires that the business verify the identity of the consumer making the request to a reasonable degree of certainty. A reasonable degree of certainty may include matching at least two data points provided by the consumer with data points maintained by the business that it has determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying the consumer. (c) A business’s compliance with a request to know specific pieces of personal information requires that the business verify the identity of the consumer making the request to a reasonably high degree of certainty. A reasonably high degree of certainty may include matching at least three pieces of personal information provided by the consumer with personal information maintained by the business that it has determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying the consumer together with a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that the requestor is the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request. If a business uses this method for verification, the business shall maintain all signed declarations as part of its record-keeping obligations. (d) A business’s compliance with a request to delete may require that the business verify the identity of the consumer to a reasonable or reasonably high degree of certainty depending on the sensitivity of the personal information and the risk of harm to the consumer posed by unauthorized deletion. For example, the deletion of family photographs may require a reasonably high degree of certainty, while the deletion of browsing history may require only a reasonable degree of certainty. A business shall act in good faith when determining the appropriate standard to apply when verifying the consumer in accordance with these regulations. (e) Illustrative examples follow: (1) Example 1: If a business maintains personal information in a manner associated with a named actual person, the business may verify the consumer by requiring the consumer to provide evidence that matches the personal information maintained by the business. For example, if a retailer maintains a record of purchases made by a consumer, the business may require the consumer to identify items that they recently purchased from the store or the dollar amount of their most recent purchase to verify their identity to a reasonable degree of certainty. (2) Example 2: If a business maintains personal information in a manner that is not associated with a named actual person, the business may verify the consumer by requiring the consumer to demonstrate that they are the sole consumer associated with the personal information. For example, a business may have a mobile application that collects personal information about the consumer but does not require an account. The business may determine whether, based on the facts and considering the factors set forth in section 999.323, subsection (b)(3), it may reasonably verify a consumer by asking them to provide information that only the person who used the mobile application may know or by requiring the consumer to respond to a notification sent to their device. (f) A business shall deny a request to know specific pieces of personal information if it cannot verify the identity of the requestor pursuant to these regulations. (g) If there is no reasonable method by which a business can verify the identity of the consumer to the degree of certainty required by this section, the business shall state so in response to any request and explain why it has no reasonable method by which it can verify the identity of the requestor. If the business has no reasonable method by which it can verify any consumer, the business shall explain why it has no reasonable verification method in its privacy policy. The business shall evaluate and document whether a reasonable method can be established at least once every 12 months, in connection with the requirement to update the privacy policy set forth in Civil Code section 1798.130, subdivision (a)(5).",article

(2) Verify their own identity directly with the business. (3) Directly confirm with the business that they provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. (b) Subsection (a) does not apply when a consumer has provided the authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to Probate Code sections 4121 to 4130. (c) An authorized agent shall implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect the consumer’s information.

This affirmative authorization is in addition to any verifiable parental consent required under COPPA. (2) Methods that are reasonably calculated to ensure that the person providing consent is the child’s parent or guardian include, but are not limited to: a. Providing a consent form to be signed by the parent or guardian under penalty of perjury and returned to the business by postal mail, facsimile, or electronic scan; b. Requiring a parent or guardian, in connection with a monetary transaction, to use a credit card, debit card, or other online payment system that provides notification of each discrete transaction to the primary account holder; c. Having a parent or guardian call a toll-free telephone number staffed by trained personnel; d. Having a parent or guardian connect to trained personnel via video-conference; e. Having a parent or guardian communicate in person with trained personnel; and f. Verifying a parent or guardian’s identity by checking a form of governmentissued identification against databases of such information, as long as the parent or guardian’s identification is deleted by the business from its records promptly after such verification is complete. (b) When a business receives an affirmative authorization pursuant to subsection (a), the business shall inform the parent or guardian of the right to opt-out and of the process for doing so on behalf of their child pursuant to section 999.315, subsections (a)-(f). (c) A business shall establish, document, and comply with a reasonable method, in accordance with the methods set forth in subsection (a)(2), for determining that a person submitting a request to know or a request to delete the personal information of a child under the age of 13 is the parent or guardian of that child.",article

Non-Discrimination - § 999.336 Discriminatory Practices in the California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations (CCPA): (a) A financial incentive or a price or service difference is discriminatory, and therefore prohibited by Civil Code section 1798.125, if the business treats a consumer differently because the consumer exercised a right conferred by the CCPA or these regulations. (b) A business may offer a financial incentive or price or service difference if it is reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data. If a business is unable to calculate a good-faith estimate of the value of the consumer’s data or cannot show that the financial incentive or price or service difference is reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data, that business shall not offer the financial incentive or price or service difference. (c) A business’s denial of a consumer’s request to know, request to delete, or request to opt-out for reasons permitted by the CCPA or these regulations shall not be considered discriminatory. (d) Illustrative examples follow: (1) Example 1: A music streaming business offers a free service as well as a premium service that costs $5 per month. If only the consumers who pay for the music streaming service are allowed to opt-out of the sale of their personal information, then the practice is discriminatory, unless the $5-per-month payment is reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data to the business. (2) Example 2: A clothing business offers a loyalty program whereby customers receive a $5-off coupon by email after spending $100 with the business. A consumer submits a request to delete all personal information the business has collected about them but also informs the business that they want to continue to participate in the loyalty program. The business may deny their request to delete with regard to their email address and the amount the consumer has spent with the business because that information is necessary for the business to provide the loyalty program requested by the consumer and is reasonably anticipated within the context of the business’s ongoing relationship with them pursuant to Civil Code section 1798.105, subdivision (d)(1). (3) Example 3: A grocery store offers a loyalty program whereby consumers receive coupons and special discounts when they provide their phone numbers. A consumer submits a request to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. The retailer complies with their request but no longer allows the consumer to participate in the loyalty program. This practice is discriminatory unless the grocery store can demonstrate that the value of the coupons and special discounts are reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data to the business. (4) Example 4: An online bookseller collects information about consumers, including their email addresses. It offers coupons to consumers through browser pop-up windows while the consumer uses the bookseller’s website. A consumer submits a request to delete all personal information that the bookseller has collected about them, including their email address and their browsing and purchasing history. The bookseller complies with the request but stops providing the periodic coupons to the consumer. The bookseller’s failure to provide coupons is discriminatory unless the value of the coupons is reasonably related to the value provided to the business by the consumer’s data. The bookseller may not deny the consumer’s request to delete with regard to the email address because the email address is not necessary to provide the coupons or reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer based on the consumer’s relationship with the business. (e) A business shall notify consumers of any financial incentive or price or service difference subject to Civil Code section 1798.125 that it offers in accordance with section 999.307. (f) A business’s charging of a reasonable fee pursuant to Civil Code section 1798.145, subdivision (i)(3), shall not be considered a financial incentive subject to these regulations. (g) A price or service difference that is the direct result of compliance with a state or federal law shall not be considered discriminatory.",article
